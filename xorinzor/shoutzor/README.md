# Shoutzor Module

The Shoutzor Module - Requires the Shoutzor Theme to function as intended


Shoutzor (optionally) uses [echoprint-codegen](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen) and [echoprint-server](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-server) for music fingerprinting to prevent double uploads.

Follow the instructions on [this page](http://echoprint.me/start) and the [github readme](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen) as for how to install echoprint-codegen on your server, then set the correct path in the shoutzor settings.
