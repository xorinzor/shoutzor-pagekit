The Shoutzor module and required theme for Pagekit.

Keep in mind this module and theme are not designed to work nice with other modules, they're intended as a standalone app.

How to install:
1. Copy the "xorinzor" directory into your pagekit's "packages" directory
2. Enable the "Shoutzor" module and set your theme to the "shoutzor-theme" theme.
3. Go to your site's pages and set the shoutzor dashboard page to be your homepage
4. Move any pages you want to be shown in the sidebar to the "main" menu parent
5. Configure your "main" menu parent to be the "main" menu.
6. Everything should now be up and running, do not forget to run the "vlc.sh" script in the "shoutzor/assets/scripts/" directory as currently there's no way of launching this from the admin panel. In fact, nothing in the admin panel is currently functional.
